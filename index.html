            I was on a journey of making an app and I quit because ndoyika ucinge uba noomarn, inobu obsession obuthile le ndiyenzayo.
            I know I broke your heart once, and I carry that regret every day. There's no amount of words that can erase the pain I made you feel.
            But still‚Ä¶ I want you to be the love of my life. It doesn't have to be now or tomorrow ‚Äî even if it takes months or years, I don't care, as long as the ending has you by my side.
        </p>
        <p>
            You know how much I love you, and I would do anything to be with you. But what I cannot do is leave you alone.
            Oku kwe second chance yokugqibela. I'm even short of words to tell you how much I love you so I decided to include best three songs explaining how I feel about you. 052022
